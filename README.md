# Isoelastic_Demand_Functions
Creating and plotting isoelastic demand functions of two kinds of peanut butter products

We are interested in estimating the demand function for two products from The J.M. Smucker Company: An 18oz jar of Creamy JIF peanut butter and an 18oz jar of Extra Crunchy peanut butter. The files “Creamy.csv” and “Crunchy.csv” contain sales and price information for 52 weeks in the Los Angeles market. The rows of both files are in the same order, thus each row in a file corresponds to the same week of sales in the other file. Examine the files and get acquainted with their content. The files have four columns with the following information:

WEEK: Week number

T.VOL: Total sales volume in ounces.

T.DLS: Total sales in Dollars

PPOZ: Price in Dollars per once corresponding to the week’s data. This is just T.DLS/(18xT.VOL).
